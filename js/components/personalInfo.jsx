      <p>I'm a self-taught, mainly thanks to FreeCodeCamp for giving me an structured learning plan, where I've already achieved 2 certificates one on Front-End Development y and another one on Data Visualization, I also have to thank youtube and stack overflow, places where sometimes I realize how little I know and how much is left to learn, with nothing left to say, programming is my passion</p>
